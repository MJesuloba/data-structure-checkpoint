Initialize sum = 0
Create an empty array called "distinct_elements"
Loop through each element in Set 1:
a. If the element is not in Set 2 and not in "distinct_elements", add it to "distinct_elements" and add it to the sum
Loop through each element in Set 2:
a. If the element is not in Set 1 and not in "distinct_elements", add it to "distinct_elements" and add it to the sum
Return the sum

pseudo-code

function sum_of_distinct_elements(set1, set2):
    sum = 0
    distinct_elements = []

    for element in set1:
        if element not in set2 and element not in distinct_elements:
            distinct_elements.append(element)
            sum += element

    for element in set2:
        if element not in set1 and element not in distinct_elements:
            distinct_elements.append(element)
            sum += element

    return sum



Problem 2 - Solution using procedures:


Define a procedure called "dot_product" which takes two vectors v1 and v2 as input and calculates their dot product (scalar product) and stores it in a variable "ps"
Define a procedure called "are_orthogonal" which takes two vectors v1 and v2 as input and checks if their dot product is zero (i.e. they are orthogonal)
a. Call the "dot_product" procedure with v1 and v2 as input to calculate their dot product and store it in a variable "ps"
b. If "ps" is equal to zero, return True (vectors are orthogonal), otherwise return False
Loop through each pair of vectors (v1, v2):
a. Call the "are_orthogonal" procedure with v1 and v2 as input to check if they are orthogonal
b. Print a message indicating whether the vectors are orthogonal or not


Pseudo-code:

procedure dot_product(v1, v2, ps):
    ps = 0
    for i in range(len(v1)):
        ps += v1[i] * v2[i]

procedure are_orthogonal(v1, v2):
    ps = 0
    dot_product(v1, v2, ps)
    if ps == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Main program
vectors = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

for i in range(len(vectors)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(vectors)):
        if are_orthogonal(vectors[i], vectors[j]):
            print(f"Vectors {i+1} and {j+1} are orthogonal")
        else:
            print(f"Vectors {i+1} and {j+1} are not orthogonal")
